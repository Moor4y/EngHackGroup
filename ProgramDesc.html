Your passion for technology shines through in this degree, with many specializations available in both hardware and software roles! You will gain thorough knowledge about all aspects of computers, from their internal parts to the complex software giving them their functionality. </p>

    <h3> Electrical engineering </h3>
    <p> Mess with wires, play with instrumentation,  or make a polling generator, you're sure to find an electrical engineer at the base of any information, power, and energy change maker! Feel the power in your grasp to be a part of the world’s best programs in the field. You are someone who is interested in harnessing the core energy source that powers our devices and the systems that improves the lives of millions. Your hands-on skills will be invaluable as you will be working with circuits and wires, but your technical knowledge will also help guide you through the rigorous engineering and math courses needed for the degree. </p>

    <h3> Environmental engineering </h3>
    <p> Studying bacterial culture and cleansing nasty soil may be gross for others to succumb to, but saving the world is important, and you bear it so they don’t have to! By applying for this degree at the University of Waterloo, you can be a part of the nation’s largest Environmental Engineering program. Learn how to make a societal change by tackling the technical aspects of environmental problems we experience today. Your insight into the details around pollution and other environmental-issues can create a long-lasting impact on policy and the future of this planet. </p>
    
    <h3> Geological engineering </h3>
    <p> Studying soil and rock behaviour is your thing, because you like to solve complex problems around the world no matter what field it’s in! So many choices proven to never be a bore, whether it's working in oil & gas, mineral exploration, hazard waste removal, or groundwater management and lots more! </p>

    <h3> Management engineering </h3>
    <p> Supply chains, fine tuning, data analytics and information systems is what you have mastered, so you make swift moves and have beauractrics flow faster! Making engineering projects run as smoothly as possible is just for you! As a management engineer, you will be a key component in any engineering project, taking charge of the resource and supply management that makes projects efficient and organized. Be your own boss! </p>
    
    <h3> Mechanical engineering </h3>
    <p> You love some good yellow cheese, whether you work on Elon’s spacecraft or make expensive meters HydroOne can’t bill and things that move, make you groove. But mechanics, power, control and manufacturing is your gear’s elbow grease, and impressing employers is your main swell. You have always been itching to use your hands to create something, so let that passion drive you to success! In this degree, you will have the opportunity to work with others to design machines of all sizes and of all functionalities, pursuing the goal of better and more efficient products. Have the power of metal and electricity at your hands and start creating! </p>

    <h3> Mechatronics engineering </h3>
    <p> From  the biometric train station down the street, or the old ATM machine that's now dead beat, to the automated cashiers at the checkout counter, computer-controlled electromechanical systems will make every human flounder. Combine a variety of disciplines into one program and voila - you have your dream program. This program demands knowledge of software, electronics, and mech, to find success in this field. You dream of making the next smart AI that can walk, talk, do your homework, and complete a ‘tron degree by itself. Just make sure not to start the robot uprising! </p>

    <h3> Nanotechnology engineering </h3>
    <p> Would you like to dip your toes in research, collaborating with the great giants? (Harvard, MIT etc.) Take the opportunity to experience Canada’s sole undergraduate program for nanotechnology, an emerging and exciting new field in a world of innovation. By using your knowledge in a variety of fields such as biology, chemistry, and quantum physics, you can be at the forefront of research and development of things that cannot even be seen by the naked eye!</p>

    <h3> Software engineering </h3>
    <p> Working in Silicon Valley may seem out of your reach, but developing your own VR software can take you right to the beach!  Enabling businesses to become tech savvy, the burden on your shoulders to analyze software, apply algorithms, understand digital design, human/ computer interfaces, becomes heavy.  Comrade, don't forget, your teammates have always got your back, so you can continue to develop and build the next Snapchat! You are driven by your passion in programming and digital hardware systems, as well as computer algorithms and interfaces. This degree is among the greatest in terms of employability - companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook are hungry for smart thinkers like you! Although you may be stereotyped as quiet and independent, that doesn’t stop you from joining the thousands of software engineers like you from being interested in a coveted spot in this program. </p>

    <h3> Systems Design engineering</h3>
    <p> Criss cross, apple sauce, connect the dots and don’t look back, it's always a loss. See the bigger picture; you have an engineering degree with flexibility! Examining people, tools & software, is what you’ll do whether you work at startup or at the ride machines at a county fair. Are you indecisive? Perhaps. Do you like the idea of engineering but are clueless about your interests? Could be so. But are you also a quick learner whose knowledge spans beyond just one subject? Probably! Your options are wide open when you go into Systems Design due to the program’s flexibility to explore the topics YOU are interested in.
